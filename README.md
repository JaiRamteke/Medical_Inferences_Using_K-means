# Medical_Inferences_Using_K-means

Introduction -
Medical imaging plays a crucial role in modern healthcare, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of
neurological disorders. Analyzing brain scans such as MRI and CT images requires identifying different
types of tissues, including white matter, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and the skull. Traditionally,
radiologists manually analyze these images to distinguish these tissues, a process that is highly timeconsuming and requires expert knowledge.
To overcome these challenges, machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, can be
used to automatically segment medical images. Clustering methods group similar regions of an image
based on pixel intensities, making it easier to identify and analyze different brain tissues. One of the
most widely used clustering algorithms for this purpose is K-Means clustering. The primary objective
of this study is to apply K-Means clustering to segment different tissues in brain scans and assess its
effectiveness in medical imaging.
By utilizing K-Means clustering, we can automate the segmentation process, reducing the burden on
medical professionals and increasing the efficiency of diagnosis. This approach enables the identification
of distinct regions in a brain scan, which can be further analyzed for abnormalities such as tumors or
structural deformities. The study aims to explore the effectiveness of K-Means clustering in medical
imaging and evaluate its performance using various metrics.


Conclusion -
In this study, we successfully implemented K-Means clustering for medical image segmentation. The
use of DICOM images allowed us to work with real-world medical datasets, ensuring practical applicability. Through clustering, we segmented different brain tissues and visualized distinct anatomical
structures.
To evaluate the performance of K-Means, we used two key metrics:
• Elbow Method: Helped determine the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the Sum of
Squared Errors (SSE).
• Silhouette Score: Ensured a balance between intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation.
The results showed that K-Means clustering is an effective technique for medical image analysis.
However, it has some limitations, such as sensitivity to the initial centroid selection. Future work
can explore advanced clustering techniques, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Deep
Learning-based segmentation, to further improve accuracy.
This study highlights the importance of machine learning in medical imaging and demonstrates
how clustering can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases efficiently. The integration of
AI with medical imaging has the potential to revolutionize diagnostics and treatment planning.
